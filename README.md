# posh-coldfusion

## Description
A PowerShell module for reading/writing Coldfusion data source passwords.

## Motivation
I needed a way to both decrypt and encrypt ColdFusion data source passwords offline that did not require java and could be run remotely. This has only been written for AES-EBC mode encryption with Coldfusion 10. Your milage may vary with other versions.

## Installation

1. Open a PowerShell prompt.
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/thezim/posh-coldfusion`
3. Run `cd posh-coldfusion`
4. Run `install.ps1`

## Usage

Import the PowerShell Module.
``` powershell
Import-Module -Name posh-coldfusion
```
Read data sources from neo-datasource.xml.
```powershell
Get-DataSources -Path neo-datasource.xml
```
Decrypt data source password.
```powershell
# read sources
$ds = Get-DataSources -Path neo-datasource.xml
# get seed info
$seedinfo = Get-SeedInfo -Path seed.properties
# decrypt using seed info
Decrypt-Text -Base64 ($ds[0].Password) -Seed ($seedinfo.Seed)
```
Encrypt new data source password.
```powershell
# get seed info
$seedinfo = Get-SeedInfo -Path seed.properties
# create cypher text
$cipher = Encrypt-Text -Seed ($seedinfo.Seed) -Text "somepassword"
# read data sources xml
$xml = [xml](Get-Content -Raw -Path neo-datasource.xml)
# set the password
Set-DataSourcePassword -Xml $xml -DataSourceName MyDatSourceName -Password $cipher
```
Note that ```Set-DataSourcePassword``` return the modifed XML an does not directly write to the data source file. **It is highly recommeneded that you ensure you backup the data source file before updating it.**

## Links
There was a really useful page that described the ColdFusion encrption process along with how it it built the ciphertext but alas I can't find it. If you know it or find it drop an issue and I'll add it.
